# org-to-bear

Example how Clojure can be used to move your notes from org-mode to Bear App. 

In my situation I have one large file with interlinked notes and I want to separate notes and preserve links between them. Of course I made some simplifications, but the main idea that you can use simplicity of Clojure to perform complicated data processing.

The core of implementation is based on ability of org-mode to export notes to HTML format that can be easily processed
